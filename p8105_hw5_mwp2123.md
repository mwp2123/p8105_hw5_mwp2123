## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    ),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df =
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  ) %>% 
  arrange(hom_unsolved)
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate….

``` r
results_df =
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x=prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  arrange(desc(estimate))
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Create tidy dataset

``` r
path_df = 
tibble(
  path = list.files("lda_data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/",path),
    obs = map(path, read_csv),
    treatment = case_when(
      str_detect(path, "con") ~ "control",
      str_detect(path, "exp") ~ "experimental"
    ),
    subject = substr(path, start = 10, stop =15),
    subject = as.factor(subject),
    treatment = as.factor(treatment)
  ) %>% 
  unnest(obs) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
              names_to ="week",
              names_prefix = "week_",
              values_to = "observations")
```

Create spaghetti
plot

``` r
ggplot(path_df, aes(x = week, y = observations, group = subject, color = treatment)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "Observations over time",x = "Week", y= "Observations"
  )
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mwp2123_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

You can see that the observations for the control group do not change
over the 8 week period but in contrast, the observations for the
experimental treatment group increase over time/
